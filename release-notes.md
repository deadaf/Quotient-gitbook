# Release Notes

## Version: 2.0.0 \| Date: \_\_-12-2020 \| Time: \_\_:\_\_ 

### Added

* A lot of commands , I can't actually count them on fingers.

### Fixed

* A lot things, I can't count this too.

Actually I have rewritten the whole bot and have added a lot of new commands and I am dumb so I didn't keep any track and I am so lazy to count and list everything now so You just have to believe me on this. Or you can actually match with the older version and see the differences ðŸ˜…. All the coming updates will be documented properly, I promise ðŸ˜‚or maybe not.

#### Thanks If you have read the whole shit.
